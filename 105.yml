Title: A Quantitative Model of Human Jejunal Smooth Muscle Cell Electrophysiology
Abstract: null
Description: "Encoded in CellML by Yong Cheng Poh\nNUS Graduate School for Integrative\
  \ Sciences and Engineering and Department of Bioengineering, National University\
  \ of Singapore\n\nModel Status\n\nThis CellML model represents the human jejunal\
  \ smooth muscle cell of the small intestine, and describes four slow waves with\
  \ a 10s period.  For more details, please refer to the  original paper, visit Computational\
  \ Bioengineering Laboratory or contact the author, Yong Cheng.\n\nAbstract\n\nRecently,\
  \ a number of ion channel mutations have been identified in the smooth muscle cells\
  \ of the human jejunum. Although these are potentially significant in understanding\
  \ diseases that are currently of unknown etiology, no suitable computational cell\
  \ model exists to evaluate the effects of such mutations. Therefore, a biophysically\
  \ based single cell model of human jejunal smooth muscle electrophysiology was developed.\
  \ The resulting cellular description is able to reproduce experimentally recorded\
  \ slow wave activity and produces realistic responses to a number of perturbations,\
  \ providing a solid platform on which the causes of intestinal myopathies can be\
  \ investigated.\n\nThe original publication reference is cited below:\n\nA Quantitative\
